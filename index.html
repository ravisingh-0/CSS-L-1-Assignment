    <!-- Poem -->
    <p>
        I met a traveller from an antique land,<br>
        Who siad-"Two vast and trunkless legs of stone" <br>
        Stand in the desert.... Near them, on the sand,<br>
        Half sunk a shattered visang lies, whies frown, <br>
        And wrinkled lip, and sneer of clod command,<br>
        Tell that its sculptor well those passions read<br>
        Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,<br>
        The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;<br>
        And on the pedestal, these words appear;<br>
        My name is <span>Ozymandias</span>, Kinf of the kings;<br>
        Look in my works, ye Mighty, and despair!<br>
        Nothing beside remains. Round the decay<br>
        of the colossal Wreck, boundless and bare<br>
        The lone and level sands stretch far away."<br>
    </p>
